## Calculating Sums FRQ
This question involves calculating the sum of a given set of integers. In this question, you will be required to write two methods of the ``Sum`` class.

```java
public class Sum {

    /** Returns the sum of all even integers between 1 and endInt, inclusive */
    public int getEvenSum(int endInt) {
    { /* implementation not shown */ }
    /** Returns true if the result of getEvenSum is greater than a random value, otherwise returns false */
    public boolean sumComparison(int endInt) 
    { /* implementation not shown */ }
    }
}
```
### Calculating Sums FRQ Part B
Write the ``sumComparison`` method which returns true if the return value of ``getEvenSum`` is greater than a randomly generated value. The randomly generated value must be divisible by 3 and 4 and be between 1 and max, inclusive. If the return value of getEvenSum is equal to or less than the randomly generated value, return false.

Write the code below.

## Calculating Sums FRQ
This question involves calculating the sum of a given set of integers. In this question, you will be required to write two methods of the ``Sum`` class.

```java
public class Sum {

    /** Returns the sum of all even integers between 1 and endInt, inclusive */
    public int getEvenSum(int endInt) {
    { /* implementation not shown */ }
    /** Returns true if the result of getEvenSum is greater than a random value, otherwise returns false */
    public boolean sumComparison(int endInt) 
    { /* implementation not shown */ }
    }
}
```

### Calculating Sums FRQ Part A
Write the ``getEvenSum`` method which returns the sum of all even integers between 1 and ``endInt``. ``endInt`` will always be greater than or equal to 1. 

The following is an example of the getEvenSum method.

| endInt | getEvenSum return value |
|--------|-------------------------|
| 3      | 2                       |
| 4      | 6                       |
| 55     | 756                     |


Write the code below.

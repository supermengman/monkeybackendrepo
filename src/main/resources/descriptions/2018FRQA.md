This question involves reasoning about arrays of integers. You will write two static methods, both of which are in a class named **ArrayTester.**

```
public class ArrayTester { 
    /* 
    Returns an array containing the elements of column c of arr2D in the same order as they appear in arr2D. 
    Precondition: c is a valid column index in arr2D. 
    Postcondition: arr2D is unchanged. 
    */ 
    public static int [] getColumn (int [1 [] arr2D, int c) 
    { /* Your code goes here */ } 

    /*
    Returns true if and only if every value in arr1 appears in arr2. 
    Precondition: arr1 and arr2 have the same length. â€¢ Postcondition: arr1 and arr2 are unchanged.
    */ 
    public static boolean hasAllValues (int [] arr1, int [] arr2) 
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

    // Returns true if arr contains any duplicate values; false otherwise. 
    public static boolean containsDuplicates (int [] arr) 
    { /* implementation not shown */ }

} 
```
        
Write a static method **getColumn**, which returns a one-dimensional array containing the elements of a single column in a two-dimensional array. The elements in the returned array should be in the same order as they appear in the given column. The notation arr2D [r] [c] represents the array element at row r and column c. 
The following code segment initializes an array and calls the **getColumn** method. 

```
int[][] arr2D = { { 0, 1, 2 } , { 3, 4, 5 } , { 6, 7, 8 } , { 9, 5, 3 } }; 
int[] result = ArrayTester.getColumn(arr2D, 1);
```

When the code segment has completed execution, the variable result will have the following contents: **{1, 4, 7, 5}**

```
public static int[] getColumn (int[] arr2D, int c) {

    // YOUR CODE IS INSERTED HERE

}
```

A crossword puzzle grid is a two-dimensional rectangular array of black and white squares. Some of the squares are labeled with a positive number according to the crossword labeling rule.

The crossword labeling rule identities squares to be labeled with a positive number as follows.
A square is labeled with a positive number if and only if
the square is white and
the square does not have a white square immediately above it, or it does not have a white square immediately to its left, or both.

The squares identified by these criteria are labeled with consecutive numbers in row-major order. starting at 1.


This question uses two classes, a Square class that represents an individual square in the puzzle and a Crossword class that represents a crossword puzzle grid. A partial declaration of the Square class is shown below.

```
public class Square
{
	/** Constructs one square of a crossword puzzle grid.
	* Postcondition:
	* - The square is black if and only if isBlack is true.
	* - The square has number num.
	* /
	public Square (boolean isBlack, int num)
	{
	/* implementation not shown * /
	}
	// There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```

A partial declaration of the Crossword class is shown below. You will implement one method and the constructor in the Crossword class.

```
public class Crossword {
	/** Each element is a Square object with a color (black or white and a number.
	* puzzle [r] [c] represents the square in row r, column c.
	* There is at least one row in the puzzle.
	* /
	private Square[][] puzzle;

	/** Constructs a crossword puzzle grid.
	* Precondition: There is at least one row in blackSquares.
	* Postcondition:
	* - The crossword puzzle grid has the same dimensions as blackSquares.
	* - The Square object at row r, column c in the crossword puzzle grid is black if and only if blackSquares [r] [c] is true.
	* - The squares in the puzzle are labeled according to the crossword labeling rule.
	* /
	public Crossword (boolean [] [] blackSquares)
	{
		/ * to be implemented in part (b) * /
	}

	/** Returns true if the square at row r, column c should be labeled with a positive number;
	* false otherwise.
	* The square at row r, column c is black if and only if blackSquares [r] [c] is true.
	* Precondition: r and c are valid indexes in blackSquares.
	* /
	private boolean toBeLabeled (int r, int c, boolean [I [I blacksquares)
	{
		/* to be implemented in part (a) * /
	}
	// There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
}
```

Write the Crossword method toBeLabeled. The method returns true if the square indexed by row r, column c in a crossword puzzle grid should be labeled with a positive number according to the crossword labeling rule; otherwise it returns false. The parameter blackSquares indicates which squares in the crossword puzzle grid are black.

```
private boolean toBeLabeled (int r, int c, boolean [I [I blacksquares)
{
	// YOUR CODE IS INSERTED HERE
}

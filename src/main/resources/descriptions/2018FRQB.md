This question involves reasoning about arrays of integers. You will write two static methods, both of which are in a class named **ArrayTester**.
```
public class ArrayTester { 
	/* 
	Returns an array containing the elements of column c of arr2D in the same order as they appear in arr2D. 
	Precondition: c is a valid column index in arr2D. 
	Postcondition: arr2D is unchanged. 
	*/ 
	public static int [] getColumn (int [1 [] arr2D, int c) 
	{ /* implementation not shown */ } 

	/*
	Returns true if and only if every value in arr1 appears in arr2. 
	Precondition: arr1 and arr2 have the same length. â€¢ Postcondition: arr1 and arr2 are unchanged.
		*/ 
	public static boolean hasAllValues (int [] arr1, int [] arr2) 
	{ /* implementation not shown */ }

	// Returns true if arr contains any duplicate values; false otherwise. 
	public static boolean containsDuplicates (int [] arr) 
	{ /* implementation not shown */ }

	/*
	Returns true if square is a Latin square as described in part (b); false otherwise. Precondition: square has an equal number of rows and columns. square has at least one row. 
	*/ 
	public static boolean isLatin (int [1 [] square) 
	{ /* Your code goes here */ } 
} 
```

Write the static method **isLatin**, which returns true if a given two-dimensional square array is a Latin square, and otherwise, returns false. A two-dimensional square array of integers is a Latin square if the following conditions are true. 
- The first row has no duplicate values.
- All values in the first row of the square appear in each row of the square. 
- All values in the first row of the square appear in each column of the square. 
Feel free to use functions defined in the ArrayTester class to help you

```
public static boolean isLatin (int[] square) {

	// YOUR CODE IS INSERTED HERE

}

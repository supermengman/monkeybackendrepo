Welcome to the Monkey Course Data Structures Challenge! Our website is designed to help students learn about data structures through an engaging and interactive online race. The challenge is to answer data structures questions to advance and compete with classmates.

Features:

- Multiple choice questions on data structures topics such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- Time-based competition to motivate students to learn and answer questions quickly.
- Progress tracking to keep track of your performance and see how you are doing compared to your classmates.
- Leaderboard to show who is leading the race in your class.

The online race is time-based, which motivates students to learn and answer questions quickly. Students can keep track of their progress and compete with their classmates to see who can complete the course first. The website also features a leaderboard to show who is leading the race in each class.

To get started, students can sign up for an account on the website and join a class or create their own class to compete with their classmates. Once the race starts, they will need to answer data structures questions as fast as they can to advance through the course.

The Monkey Course Data Structures Challenge is perfect for students who are looking for a fun and engaging way to learn about data structures. Whether you are new to data structures or looking to improve your skills, our website will help you become a data structures expert while competing with your classmates.
